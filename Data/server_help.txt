The server is built on RakNet (c) and uses the best practices described in their documentation. This means that, to ensure correct endianness for both client and server, data is sent through RakNet::BitStream structures and does not use custom message structures.

Usage: 
	Connecting to the server is explained in the online documentation of RakNet (c)

	In the following text the structure of the message that can be sent are described as follows:
		MSG: MESSAGE_ID
			DATA_1: DataType(<DataName>)
			DATA_2: DataType(<DataName>)
			...

	Where:
		MESSAGE_ID				is the enumeration value that should be sent.
		DATA_1, DATA_2, ...		are types (DataType) and indications of the kind of data (DataName) that should be added to the bitstream, in that order.

	After the ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED message has been received the following messages can be sent:

	MSG: EMessage_ServerHelp
	MSG: EMessage_GameHelp
		DATA_1: EGame(<GAME>)

	MSG: EMessage_SendLogin
		DATA_1: RakString(<LOGIN>)
		DATA_2: RakString(<PASSWORD>)

	MSG: EMessage_SendDisconnect
	MSG: EMessage_SendJoinGame
		DATA_1: uint32_t(<CLIENT ID>)
		DATA_2: EGame(<GAME>)

	MSG: EMessage_SendWhoseTurnIsIt

	Any of the previous messages can send a result to the client. The following are messages the client may receive:

	EMessage_RecvServerHelp
		DATA1: RakString(<HELPTEXT>)

	EMessage_RecvGameHelp
		DATA1: RakString(<HELPTEXT>)

	EMessage_RecvLoginSuccess
		DATA_1: uint32_t(<CLIENT ID>)
		
	EMessage_RecvDisconnected
	EMessage_RecvWaitingForPlayers
	EMessage_RecvJoinGame
	EMessage_RecvServerError
		DATA_1: EServerError(<ERROR>)
